(See also lymphography and primary-tumor.) This data set includes 201 instances of one class and 85 instances of another class. The instances are described by 9 attributes, some of which are linear and some are nominal. 1.1.2 Attribute Information Class: no-recurrence-events, recurrence-events age: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-99. menopause: lt40, ge40, premeno. tumor-size: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59. inv-nodes: 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17, 18-20, 21-23, 24-26, 27-29, 30-32, 33-35, 36-39. node-caps: yes, no. deg-malig: 1, 2, 3. breast: left, right. breast-quad: left-up, left-low, right-up, right-low, central. irradiat:8 yes, no. 1.2 The modeling goal To predict if there is a breast cancer recurrence based on features age,tumor-size, inv-nodesâ€¦ 1.3 The models for using Logistic Regression KNN Decision tree Random forest.
